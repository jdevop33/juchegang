# Communist Background Image Setup

## How to add your communist-style background image:

1. **Save your image** (the red one with hammer & sickle, Korean text, etc.) to:
   ```
   /home/jesse/projects/juche/juchegang/public/images/featured-bg.jpg
   ```

2. **The image should be**:
   - High resolution (1920x1080 or similar)
   - Strong red color scheme
   - Communist/revolutionary imagery
   - Korean text and symbols

## Current Status:
- ✅ Component is ready and configured
- ✅ All TypeScript errors fixed
- ✅ Proper overlay system for text readability
- ⏳ Need to replace placeholder image with your actual background

## After saving the image:
The featured law cards will automatically display with:
- Your dramatic communist background
- Layered gradients for text readability
- Professional styling and animations
- Responsive design across all devices

Once you save the image, refresh the browser to see the changes!
