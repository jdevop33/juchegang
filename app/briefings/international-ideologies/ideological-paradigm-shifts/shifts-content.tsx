      <p className="mb-6 leading-7">
        Idea: some “can’t‑resolve” disagreements point to competing ideological frameworks (values + explanations) in motion. As
        one rises and another fades, clashes intensify — similar to shifts between scientific paradigms (Kuhn).

      <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-bold">Plain takeaways</h2>
      <ul className="mb-8 list-disc space-y-3 pl-6">
        <li>Deep disagreements often rest on different starting points (what counts as evidence, whose interests matter).</li>
        <li>These frameworks are ideological: they justify and organize social orders; they also produce identities.</li>
        <li>Like science, ideologies can “shift” when anomalies pile up and a rival frame explains more or fits the times better.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Why it matters</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>Read conflicts as signals of transition, not just polarization.</li>
          <li>Look for bridge concepts (shared goals, concrete outcomes) to translate across frameworks.</li>
          <li>Track which institutions, media, and policies reinforce each paradigm.</li>
