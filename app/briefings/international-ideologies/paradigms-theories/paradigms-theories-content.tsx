      <p className="mb-6 leading-7">
        Based on DeCarlo (2018), Scientific Inquiry in Social Work (CC BY‑NC‑SA). Paradigms are the lenses we use to see the
        world — assumptions about what is real and how we can know it. Theories then explain specific “how/why” relationships
        within those lenses.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-bold">Four paradigms (plain language)</h2>
      <ul className="mb-8 list-disc space-y-3 pl-6">
        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Positivism</span>: objective truths exist; measure carefully; deductive logic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Social constructionism</span>: truth varies by people and context; meanings are made in interaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Critical</span>: focuses on power, inequality, and change; research should aid liberation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Postmodern</span>: skeptical of universal truths; knowledge is historically/culturally bound.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-bold">What’s a theory?</h2>
      <p className="mb-6 leading-7">
        A theory is a set of linked ideas that explains some part of social life (e.g., systems, conflict, symbolic interaction,
        social exchange). Paradigms set the worldview; theories do the explaining.

        <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">How beliefs form (objective, human)</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>Early socialization: family, caregivers, and community norms shape default assumptions.</li>
          <li>Culture & language: school, media, and peers reinforce shared meanings and habits.</li>
          <li>Experience: new people and evidence can update or confirm our lens over time.</li>
          <li>Uniqueness & commonality: we share much as humans, yet each person’s path is slightly different.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>Positivist: measure prevalence and causes with surveys/experiments.</li>
          <li>Constructionist: interview people about meanings and identities.</li>
          <li>Critical: analyze laws/stigma; aim to change oppressive structures.</li>
          <li>Postmodern: narrative of one person’s changing self‑understanding.</li>
