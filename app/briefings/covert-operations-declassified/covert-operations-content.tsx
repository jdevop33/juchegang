          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">When Wedding Guests Became Targets</h2>
          
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            On December 12, 2013, four Hellfire missiles struck a wedding convoy traveling between villages in Yemen's al-Bayda province. 
            <strong> Twelve men aged 20-65 were killed instantly, and 15 wounded including the bride, who suffered shrapnel wounds under her eye.</strong> 
            The Pentagon initially claimed all casualties were Al-Qaeda militants.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Human Rights Watch investigators later confirmed it was a genuine wedding procession. The Yemeni government, acknowledging the error, 
            paid families $110,000 and delivered 101 Kalashnikov rifles as a traditional apology gesture.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            This pattern repeated across multiple countries: a November 2008 strike in Afghanistan's Kandahar province killed 
            <strong> 37 wedding guests including 23 children and 10 women</strong>, with the bride among the wounded.

              "The targeting of celebrations extended beyond weddings. Between 2009-2012, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism documented that 
              <strong> more than 20 civilians were attacked in deliberate strikes on funerals</strong> in Pakistan."

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            CIA-backed Afghan strike forces known as "Zero Units" operated outside military oversight from 2008-2021. 
            <strong> Just one unit killed at least 452 civilians in 107 raids over four years</strong>, according to ProPublica's investigation 
            of declassified documents.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Soldiers were required to sign pre-written reports claiming no civilian casualties occurred, while children killed in raids 
            were classified in reports as "TITS" - terrorists in training.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            The most devastating recent example occurred on August 29, 2021, in Kabul. A drone strike targeting what the Pentagon called 
            ISIS-K terrorists instead killed aid worker Zemari Ahmadi and nine family members. 
            <strong> The dead included seven children: Zamir (20), Faisal (16), Farzad (10), Arwin (7), Benyamin (6), Hayat (2), and Malika (3).</strong>
