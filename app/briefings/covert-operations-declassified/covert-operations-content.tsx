          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            On December 12, 2013, four Hellfire missiles struck a wedding convoy traveling between villages in Yemen's al-Bayda province. 
            <strong> Twelve men aged 20-65 were killed instantly, and 15 wounded including the bride, who suffered shrapnel wounds under her eye.</strong> 
            The Pentagon initially claimed all casualties were Al-Qaeda militants.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Human Rights Watch investigators later confirmed it was a genuine wedding procession. The Yemeni government, acknowledging the error, 
            paid families $110,000 and delivered 101 Kalashnikov rifles as a traditional apology gesture.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            This pattern repeated across multiple countries: a November 2008 strike in Afghanistan's Kandahar province killed 
            <strong> 37 wedding guests including 23 children and 10 women</strong>, with the bride among the wounded.
          </p>

              "The targeting of celebrations extended beyond weddings. Between 2009-2012, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism documented that 
              <strong> more than 20 civilians were attacked in deliberate strikes on funerals</strong> in Pakistan."

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            CIA-backed Afghan strike forces known as "Zero Units" operated outside military oversight from 2008-2021. 
            <strong> Just one unit killed at least 452 civilians in 107 raids over four years</strong>, according to ProPublica's investigation 
            of declassified documents.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Soldiers were required to sign pre-written reports claiming no civilian casualties occurred, while children killed in raids 
            were classified in reports as "TITS" - terrorists in training.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            The most devastating recent example occurred on August 29, 2021, in Kabul. A drone strike targeting what the Pentagon called 
            ISIS-K terrorists instead killed aid worker Zemari Ahmadi and nine family members. 
            <strong> The dead included seven children: Zamir (20), Faisal (16), Farzad (10), Arwin (7), Benyamin (6), Hayat (2), and Malika (3).</strong>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The CIA's post-9/11 detention program operated across 54 countries, with confirmed black sites in Afghanistan, Lithuania, 
            Morocco, Poland, Romania, and Thailand. <strong> At least 136 individuals were subjected to "enhanced interrogation" - 
            torture techniques including waterboarding, mock executions, rectal feeding, and prolonged nudity in freezing temperatures.</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report, based on 6 million classified documents, found the torture was 
            "more brutal, systematic, and widespread" than previously disclosed.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <strong> Of the 17 soldiers removed from duty at Abu Ghraib, no officer above company commander level was prosecuted.</strong> 
            The International Red Cross had reported the abuses to US authorities months before public exposure, but no action was taken.

            On December 20, 1989, US forces attacked Panama City's El Chorrillo neighborhood during Operation Just Cause. 
            The heavily populated Afro-Panamanian district was destroyed by fires following the assault. Residents called it "Little Hiroshima."

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <strong> While the Pentagon claimed 202 civilians died, the UN estimated 500 deaths, Americas Watch documented 300, 
            and the Roman Catholic Church counted 673 total Panamanian casualties.</strong> Panama now observes December 20 as a National Day of Mourning.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            From 1953-1973, the CIA's MK-ULTRA program conducted mind control experiments on unwitting US and Canadian citizens. 
            <strong> At least 162 experiments across 80+ institutions subjected prisoners, hospital patients, and ordinary civilians 
            to LSD, sensory deprivation, electroshock, and psychological torture.</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Canadian citizens at Montreal's Allan Memorial Institute were subjected to "depatterning" - massive electroshock treatments 
            combined with drug-induced comas lasting months. Many subjects were "permanently shattered," never recovering their memories or ability to function.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Gulf of Tonkin incident demonstrates how deception sparked full-scale war. On August 4, 1964, the Pentagon claimed 
            North Vietnamese forces attacked US destroyers in international waters. 
            <strong> The war ultimately killed 58,220 Americans and over 3 million Vietnamese.</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            In 2003, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara admitted "there was no attack" that night. A 2005 declassified NSA study 
            revealed intelligence was deliberately "skewed" to create the impression of an attack that never occurred.

            Between 2004-2018, US drone strikes in Pakistan killed between 2,515-4,026 people, including

            The Vietnam War's Operation Phoenix ran from 1965-1972 as a targeted assassination program.

            Testimony before Congress in 1971 described it as a "sterile depersonalized murder program."

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Beyond immediate casualties, these operations created lasting trauma. Communities where night raids occurred saw
