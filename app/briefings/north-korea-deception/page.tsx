        <h2>The Media Manufacturing Machine</h2>
        <p>Major outlets covering the DPRK are structurally embedded in U.S. information operations …</p>

        <h2>The Defector Industrial Complex</h2>
        <p>Testimonies are routinely selected and amplified through market incentives that reward sensation over nuance …</p>

        <h2>Frozen Conflict Capitalism</h2>
        <p>The unresolved armistice sustains a permanent emergency that justifies bases, deployments, and weapons programs …</p>

        <h2>Double Standards of Human Rights</h2>
        <p>Identical practices are framed as tyranny when foreign, and necessity when domestic …</p>

        <h2>Cyber False Flags and Ambiguity Arbitrage</h2>
        <p>Cyber attributions thrive on uncertainty and reliably drive appropriations …</p>

        <h2>The Threat Inflation Machine</h2>
        <p>From WMDs to great‑power competition, the apparatus continuously repackages enemies …</p>

        <h2>Information Warfare in the Digital Age</h2>
        <p>Funding streams sustain media, academic, and NGO ecosystems producing ostensibly independent expertise …</p>

        <h2>Real Stakes: Architecture of Hegemony</h2>
        <p>The DPRK narrative underwrites basing, arms sales, and dependency structures that anchor U.S. primacy in East Asia …</p>

        <h2>The Blueprint Replicated</h2>
        <p>The same playbook scales to Ukraine and Taiwan …</p>

        <h2>How to See Clearly</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Follow the money behind outlets, experts, and reports. Independence is the exception.</li>
          <li>Seek perspectives outside security‑state funding chains; compare claims under consistent standards.</li>
          <li>Stress‑test plausibility: logistics, capacity, and incentives — not just headlines.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Recognizing manufactured consent mechanisms isn’t endorsement of any government; it’s refusal to be manipulated into policies that
          enrich contractors and entrench hegemony at the public’s expense.
