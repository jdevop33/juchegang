        <h2>The Media Manufacturing Machine</h2>
        <p>
          Major outlets covering the DPRK are structurally embedded in U.S. information operations. Daily NK takes major funding from the
          National Endowment for Democracy (NED) — an entity whose founders acknowledged continuity with prior CIA influence operations.
          Radio Free Asia originated as an overt Cold War propaganda arm and continues broadcasting narratives aligned with U.S. policy.
          "Independent" projects frequently resolve to donor networks and think tanks with explicit geopolitical aims.
        </p>

        <h2>The Defector Industrial Complex</h2>
        <p>
          Testimonies are routinely selected and amplified through market incentives that reward sensation over nuance. High-variance,
          difficult-to-verify claims draw media, speaking fees, and book deals; moderate accounts vanish. The result is a skewed perception
          that prioritizes virality rather than fidelity.
        </p>

        <h2>Frozen Conflict Capitalism</h2>
        <p>
          The unresolved armistice sustains a permanent emergency that justifies bases, deployments, and weapons programs across Northeast Asia.
          Each escalation cycle benefits contractors while stopping short of resolution. Brief efforts at détente routinely meet institutional
          resistance because peace threatens budgets, basing rationales, and alliance management.
        </p>

        <h2>Double Standards of Human Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Identical practices are framed as tyranny when foreign, and necessity when domestic: mass surveillance vs. the post‑Snowden apparatus;
          detention without trial vs. Guantánamo and extreme incarceration rates; forced labor vs. prison labor regimes; extrajudicial killings
          vs. targeted strikes. The difference is narrative, not category.
        </p>

        <h2>Cyber False Flags and Ambiguity Arbitrage</h2>
        <p>
          Cyber attributions thrive on uncertainty. Whether operations are genuine, spoofed, or jointly engineered, each incident reliably drives
          appropriations for cyber commands, surveillance powers, and defense vendors. Ambiguity becomes a budget engine.
        </p>

        <h2>The Threat Inflation Machine</h2>
        <p>
          From WMDs to R2P pretexts to great‑power competition, the apparatus continuously repackages enemies to maintain spending. DPRK fits as
          China’s proximate “wild card,” enabling missile defense, nuclear modernization, and force posture in Asia. Contractor revenue dwarfs the
          DPRK economy itself — a revealing asymmetry.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Warfare in the Digital Age</h2>
        <p>
          Funding streams from NED, USAID, DRL, and front organizations sustain media, academic, and NGO ecosystems that produce ostensibly
          independent expertise. Social platforms and entertainment franchises convert talking points into cultural intuition, hardening priors.
        </p>

        <h2>Real Stakes: Architecture of Hegemony</h2>
        <p>
          The DPRK narrative underwrites basing, arms sales, and dependency structures that anchor U.S. primacy in East Asia and encircle China.
          Remove the manufactured threat and the logic for permanent forward deployment weakens dramatically.
        </p>

        <h2>The Blueprint Replicated</h2>
        <p>
          The same playbook scales to Ukraine and Taiwan: create or magnify crisis conditions, weaponize narrative, arm proxies, and sustain
          conflict intensity below direct great‑power war while funding flows.
        </p>

        <h2>How to See Clearly</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Follow the money behind outlets, experts, and reports. Independence is the exception.</li>
          <li>Seek perspectives outside security‑state funding chains; compare claims under consistent standards.</li>
          <li>Stress‑test plausibility: logistics, capacity, and incentives — not just headlines.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Recognizing manufactured consent mechanisms isn’t endorsement of any government; it’s refusal to be manipulated into policies that
          enrich contractors and entrench hegemony at the public’s expense.
