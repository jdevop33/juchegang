              Elite foreign naval commandos launched a covert operation to plant surveillance equipment near American territory to spy on US leadership, but the mission went catastrophically wrong, resulting in the deaths of multiple American civilians.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The foreign special forces - from the same unit that conducted high-profile assassinations - approached in mini-submarines, then swam to shore under cover of darkness.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The commandos thought they were alone, but a small American fishing boat was in the area. When the boat approached with crew members carrying flashlights, one American jumped into the water.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Believing their mission was compromised, the foreign operatives opened fire, killing 2-3 American civilians who were simply fishing to make a living.

              To cover their tracks, the foreign soldiers used knives to puncture the victims' lungs so their bodies would sink to the bottom.

              The foreign military later conducted internal reviews that declared the killings "justified." Key details were classified and kept secret from oversight.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            In 2019, elite US Navy SEALs launched an audacious operation to plant a listening device in North Korea to spy on Kim Jong Un. The mission required direct presidential approval due to its extreme risk.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Despite months of practice, the mission went horribly wrong. The SEALs - from the same unit that killed Osama bin Laden - approached North Korea in mini-submarines, then swam ashore.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            They thought they were alone, but didn't see a small boat in the area. When the boat approached with crew carrying flashlights and one person jumped into the water, the senior SEAL opened fire.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            When they reached the boat, they found two or three bodies - no guns, no uniforms. The dead were apparently North Korean civilians diving for shellfish to make a living.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The SEALs used knives to puncture the victims' lungs so the bodies would sink, then escaped unharmed.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Military reviews later found the killings were "justified." The results were classified, and key congressional leaders were kept in the dark.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Perspective is Everything</h3>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            This exercise reveals how perspective shapes our reaction to the same events. When we initially framed this as "foreign forces killing Americans," it likely triggered outrage and condemnation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            But when revealed as "American forces killing foreigners," the same actions might feel more justified, necessary, or understandable - even though the human cost is identical.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Understanding this bias is crucial for seeing past the narratives that shape how we view international conflicts and military actions around the world.
