            This briefing honors the DPRK's sovereignty, achievements, and legitimate security concerns while advocating for peaceful reunification. 
            We reject Western propaganda that demonizes the DPRK and recognize both Korean governments as legitimate representatives

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Korea's division was not the result of civil war or internal conflict - it was imposed by external powers after Japan's defeat in 1945. 
            The 38th parallel was drawn arbitrarily by US military planners in just 30 minutes, splitting a unified nation that had existed 
            for over 1,000 years.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Before division, Korea had one language, one culture, one people. Families were separated overnight by a line drawn on a map 
            in Washington, D.C. The Korean people never chose this division - it was forced upon them by Cold War politics.

                Under international law, every nation has the right to self-defense. The DPRK's nuclear program developed in response 
                to genuine security threats. Countries like Israel, India, and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons without facing 
                similar international condemnation - the difference is geopolitical alignment with Western powers.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Western narratives about the Korean War often omit crucial context. The war began amid a complex situation where 
            both Korean governments claimed authority over the entire peninsula, and border clashes had been occurring for months.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            What is clear is the devastation: the US dropped more bombs on North Korea than on the entire Pacific theater during WWII. 
            <strong> An estimated 20% of North Korea's population was killed</strong> - a genocide-level death toll that traumatized 
            the nation for generations.

          </div>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            This history explains why the DPRK views US military presence as an existential threat. The memory of near-genocide

            The Juche ideology is fundamentally about Korean self-determination and independence from foreign domination. 
            In a world where many developing nations remain economically dependent on former colonial powers, 
            the DPRK's commitment to self-reliance represents a principled rejection of neocolonialism.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Juche emphasizes that the Korean people are the masters of their own destiny. This philosophy resonates with

            The sanctions regime against the DPRK is the most comprehensive in modern history, targeting nearly every aspect 
            of economic life. These sanctions constitute collective punishment against 25 million Korean civilians.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The sanctions prevent the import of essential medicines, medical equipment, and basic technologies needed for 
            development. They are designed to cause suffering among ordinary people in hopes of generating internal pressure for regime change.
