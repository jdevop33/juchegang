## HERO IMAGES (Website Headers)

### 1. The Tiger Peninsula — Primary Hero
```
A majestic Amur tiger composed of the Korean peninsula landmass, facing left toward Asia. The tiger's body IS the geography — mountains form the spine, coastlines form the fur edges, rivers flow as stripes. Dawn light breaks over the East Sea (Sea of Japan), golden hour illumination. The 38th parallel is subtly visible as a faint scar across the tiger's midsection, but the tiger is clearly ONE creature. Style: hyper-detailed digital painting, traditional Korean ink wash (sumukhwa) influence, muted earth tones with gold accents. No text. Cinematic composition, 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

### 2. Tiger Awakening — Animated Hero Concept
```
A sleeping tiger made of mountains and forests slowly opening its eyes, golden light emanating from within. The landscape IS the tiger — Baekdu Mountain is the head, the DMZ cuts across the belly but the body is whole. Morning mist rising, cherry blossoms and pine trees visible in the fur-terrain. First rays of sunrise hitting the tiger's face. Ethereal, hopeful, powerful. Style: Studio Ghibli meets traditional Korean landscape painting (sansu-hwa). Warm golden and green palette. 16:9 cinematic.
```

### 3. One Tiger Map — Clean Graphic Version
```
Minimalist graphic design of the Korean peninsula as a tiger silhouette. Clean vector style, single bold color (tiger gold #FFB800) on deep indigo background (#1E1B4B). The tiger shape clearly shows the peninsula geography — head at the north, tail at the south, legs reaching toward Japan and China. No 38th parallel line. Modern, iconic, logo-ready. Style: flat design, bold shapes, suitable for merchandise and social media icons. Square 1:1 aspect ratio.
```

## CULTURAL UNITY IMAGES

### 4. Same Blood Different Weather — Chuseok Tables
```
Split image: two identical Korean Chuseok (harvest festival) tables seen from above. Left side labeled "Seoul" with warm autumn light, right side labeled "Pyongyang" with similar warm light. IDENTICAL foods on both tables: songpyeon (rice cakes), japchae (glass noodles), bulgogi, kimchi, jeon (pancakes), fruits, makgeolli. Same ancestral ritual setup, same love, same tradition. The only difference is the background — one modern apartment, one traditional ondol room. Both beautiful, both Korean. Style: warm food photography aesthetic, rich colors, nostalgic feeling. 16:9 horizontal split.
```

### 5. Same Hanbok, Same Heart
```
Two Korean women in traditional hanbok facing each other in profile, hands almost touching. One from the North (Joseon-ot style with slightly higher waistline), one from the South (modernized hanbok). Nearly identical garments in harmonious colors — one in traditional indigo, one in soft pink. Their faces show longing, recognition, sisterhood. Background: soft gradient suggesting dawn, divided at center but the colors blend. Style: elegant portrait photography aesthetic, soft lighting, emotional. Vertical 9:16 for social.
```

### 6. One Language, One People
```
Beautiful calligraphy artwork showing the Korean word "하나" (hana, meaning "one") written in elegant brushstrokes. The brushstroke begins at the top of the frame (north) and flows down to the bottom (south) in one continuous movement — you cannot paint this word without connecting north to south. Background: traditional hanji (Korean paper) texture, aged cream color. Subtle tiger watermark visible behind the calligraphy. Style: traditional Korean calligraphy (seoye) with modern minimalist presentation. Square 1:1.
```

### 7. The Tiger Doesn't See the Line
```
An Amur/Siberian tiger walking through a misty Korean forest, viewed from the side. In the background, subtle military fence posts and DMZ markers, but the tiger walks right through — ghostlike, unbothered, free. The tiger represents the Korean spirit that cannot be caged. Dense forest, morning fog, shafts of light. The tiger is walking from north to south (right to left), powerful and serene. Style: wildlife photography aesthetic meets magical realism. Cinematic, moody, powerful. 16:9 horizontal.
```

## HERITAGE & HISTORY IMAGES

### 8. 4,000 Years, One People
```
Timeline visualization flowing like a river from top to bottom. Ancient Korea (Gojoseon, bronze mirrors, dolmen) at top, flowing through Three Kingdoms, Goryeo, Joseon dynasty, Japanese occupation, liberation, division, to present. The river is ONE continuous flow — it never splits. Korean cultural symbols float in the river: tiger motifs, celadon pottery, hangeul letters, traditional instruments. At 1945, the river gets a scar but doesn't divide. Style: illustrated infographic, traditional Korean color palette (dancheong — red, blue, yellow, white, black), flowing organic shapes. Vertical long-scroll format.
```

### 9. The Original Tiger Map (1908 Homage)
```
Recreation of Ch'oe Namsŏn's 1908 vision of Korea as a tiger, but refined. Antique map aesthetic, aged paper texture, hand-drawn cartographic style. The Korean peninsula drawn as a tiger with raised paw, leaping toward the Asian continent. Old Korean text labels in classical style. Subtle grid lines like historical maps. Color palette: sepia, aged cream, faded indigo ink, touches of gold. Style: antique map illustration, museum artifact quality. Can be square or vertical.
```

### 10. Separated Families — 10 Million Hearts
```
Emotional portrait: an elderly Korean grandmother holding a faded black-and-white photograph of a young man (her brother, separated since 1950). Her face shows 70 years of longing, hope still alive in her eyes. She wears simple traditional Korean clothing. The photograph in her hands shows a young soldier or civilian from the Korean War era. Soft window light, intimate moment. This is one of 10 million stories. Style: documentary portrait photography, warm but melancholic, shallow depth of field. Vertical 4:5 for Instagram.
```

---

## SOCIAL MEDIA GRAPHICS

### 11. Tiger Eye Close-Up (Profile Picture)
```
Extreme close-up of an Amur tiger's eye, golden-amber iris with the reflection of the Korean peninsula visible in the pupil. Intense, focused, patient. The eye is waking up, alert. Fur detail around the eye shows traditional Korean patterns subtly woven in. Style: hyperrealistic digital art, macro photography aesthetic, dramatic lighting. Square 1:1, perfect for profile pictures across platforms.
```

### 12. Quote Card Template — Tiger Gold
```
Minimalist quote card design. Deep indigo background (#0F0D2A). Elegant cream text. Small tiger silhouette watermark in corner. Korean proverb in both Hangul and English translation. Example: "호랑이는 죽어서 가죽을 남기고 사람은 죽어서 이름을 남긴다" / "A tiger leaves its skin, a person leaves their name." Gold accent line. Style: modern minimal typography, sophisticated, shareable. Square 1:1 and vertical 9:16 versions.
```

### 13. Did You Know? Series Template
```
Educational infographic card. Tiger gold (#FFB800) header bar with "Did You Know?" text. White/cream content area with single surprising fact about Korean unity. Small icon illustrations. Footer with Juche.org branding. Example fact: "North and South Koreans can still understand each other perfectly — the language diverged less in 70 years than English did in 200." Style: clean infographic design, friendly but informative, highly shareable. Square 1:1.
```

### 14. The DMZ Wildlife Corridor
```
Aerial/bird's eye view of the DMZ showing it as an unintentional nature preserve. Lush green corridor cutting across the peninsula, wildlife visible: deer, cranes, possibly a tiger shadow. Military installations visible at edges but nature has reclaimed the center. Irony: the most divided place became a sanctuary. Beautiful and bittersweet. Style: nature documentary photography aesthetic, drone shot, golden hour. 16:9 horizontal.
```

## LINKEDIN & PROFESSIONAL IMAGES

### 15. AI Dialogue Visualization
```
Abstract visualization of a human and AI having a dialogue that changes both. Two silhouettes facing each other — one human (representing J Panda/Jesse), one geometric/digital (representing Claude). Between them, a flowing exchange of light, ideas transforming. What starts as confrontation becomes collaboration. The space between them contains emerging imagery: a tiger, a united peninsula, peace symbols. Style: abstract digital art, flowing particles, warm human tones meeting cool digital blues, convergence in gold. 16:9 horizontal for LinkedIn header.
```

### 16. Economic Potential — Unified Korea
```
Professional infographic showing unified Korea's potential: map of Korea glowing gold, surrounded by data visualizations suggesting economic power. Subtle comparisons to Germany's reunification success. Key statistics floating: combined GDP potential, shared resources, strategic location. Professional, not propagandistic. Style: clean data visualization, business presentation quality, blues and golds. 16:9 horizontal for LinkedIn articles.
```

---

## LETTERS ACROSS THE 38TH — DIGITAL DMZ

### 17. Sacred Space Header
```
Serene, contemplative image for the Letters section. A traditional Korean writing desk (munbangsa-u) with brush, ink stone, and hanji paper. A letter in progress, beautiful calligraphy visible. Soft natural light from a window showing misty mountains. The feeling of sacred communication, words that matter. No technology visible — timeless. Style: still life photography meets traditional Korean aesthetics, warm muted tones, peaceful. 16:9 horizontal hero image.
```

### 18. Paper Crane Divider
```
Simple, elegant image of a Korean paper crane (jongi jeobgi) resting on traditional paper. The crane represents peace, hope, messages carried across distances. Soft shadows, minimal composition, zen-like simplicity. Could be used as section divider or background. Style: minimalist product photography, muted cream and white tones, subtle texture. Wide horizontal for section breaks.
```

### 19. Bridge of Words
```
Conceptual image: a bridge made of Korean letters (Hangul characters) spanning a chasm. The letters form a continuous stream connecting two cliffs. Each letter glows softly. The bridge is made of words, of communication, of shared language. Below the bridge, fog or clouds — the unknown. Above, a hopeful sky with dawn colors. Style: surrealist conceptual art, dreamlike atmosphere, hope-filled. 16:9 horizontal.
```

## ANIMATED/VIDEO CONCEPTS

### 20. Tiger Breathing — Loading Animation
```
Subtle animation concept: minimalist tiger silhouette (Korean peninsula shape) that gently pulses as if breathing. The chest area expands and contracts slowly — 4 second cycle. Represents the tiger sleeping but alive, patient, waiting. Colors: tiger gold on deep indigo, subtle glow on exhale. Style: minimal motion graphics, smooth easing, meditative loop. Perfect for loading states or hero background. Square or 16:9.
```

### 21. 38th Parallel Dissolving
```
Animation concept: the Korean peninsula shown as a tiger with a visible scar/line at the 38th parallel. Slowly, over 10 seconds, the line fades, dissolves, heals. The tiger becomes whole. The fur patterns reconnect. Mountains that were separated rejoin their ranges. Rivers flow unimpeded. Final frame: one complete tiger. Style: elegant morphing animation, hopeful music suggested, cinematic. 16:9 for YouTube/video headers.
```

### 22. Leenalchi-Style Tiger — Music Visual
```
Video concept inspired by Leenalchi's "Tiger Is Coming" aesthetic. Stylized tiger running/dancing, bold graphic shapes, traditional Korean patterns animated with modern energy. High contrast colors: red, gold, black, white. Unexpected movements, rhythmic, hypnotic. The tiger moves from frame to frame, sometimes realistic, sometimes abstract geometric shapes. Style: motion graphics meets traditional Korean design (dancheong patterns), music video energy. Vertical 9:16 for TikTok/Reels.
```
