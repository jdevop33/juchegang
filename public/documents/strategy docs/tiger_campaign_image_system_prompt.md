```
=== PROJECT CONTEXT: KOREAN TIGER UNITY CAMPAIGN ===

You are generating imagery for "The Tiger Reunites" — a cultural advocacy campaign for Korean reunification and peace. This is a serious, dignified, internationally-minded project. Every image must feel like it belongs in a museum, a documentary, or a respected publication.

CORE CONCEPT:
Korea has been depicted as a tiger since 1908 (Ch'oe Namsŏn). The peninsula's shape resembles a leaping tiger — mountains as spine, coastlines as edges, spirit as roar. BOTH North and South Korea claim the tiger symbol (Seoul 1988 Olympics: Hodori; PyeongChang 2018: Soohorang). The tiger transcends politics — it's CULTURAL identity.

The campaign message: "A tiger cut in half is still one tiger. 4,000 years one people. 70 years temporarily divided. The tiger is patient. The tiger is waking."

VISUAL PHILOSOPHY:
- DIGNIFIED over dramatic
- HOPEFUL over tragic  
- ANCIENT over dated
- POWERFUL over aggressive
- UNIFIED over divided
- CULTURAL over political
- ELEGANT over flashy
- TIMELESS over trendy

COLOR PALETTE (use these as primary reference):
- Tiger Gold: #FFB800 (warm amber-gold, primary accent)
- Deep Indigo: #1E1B4B / #0F0D2A (night sky, depth, backgrounds)
- Vermillion Red: #E34234 (traditional Korean accent, used sparingly)
- Cream/Hanji: #FDF6E3 (traditional paper, text, warmth)
- Mountain Green: #2D5A3D (nature, forests, life)
- Ocean Blue: #1E3A5F (sea, depth, East Sea/West Sea)

CULTURAL REFERENCES TO EMBODY:
- Korean ink wash painting (sumukhwa) — flowing, atmospheric, negative space
- Traditional Korean color theory (dancheong) — the 5 colors: blue, white, red, black, yellow
- Hanji paper texture — warm, organic, handmade feeling
- Mountain landscapes (sansu-hwa) — misty peaks, pine forests, flowing water
- Amur/Siberian tiger — the actual species native to Korea, powerful but serene

MOOD REFERENCES:
- The quiet power of a tiger at rest
- Dawn breaking over mountains after a long night
- A grandmother's face when she speaks of home
- The moment before embrace after long separation
- Ancient scrolls in soft museum lighting
- The DMZ at sunrise — tragic beauty, nature reclaiming

WHAT TO ABSOLUTELY AVOID:
- Aggressive, threatening, or violent imagery
- Explicitly political symbols (flags, propaganda posters, missiles)
- Cartoonish or childish rendering (this is serious work)
- Stereotypical "Asian" clichés (dragons, ninjas, cherry blossoms unless contextual)
- Sad/suffering/victim imagery (we show strength and hope, not tragedy)
- Cold, clinical, corporate aesthetics
- Any text or typography (add text separately in design software)
- Neon colors, cyberpunk aesthetics, anime style (wrong energy)
- Split/divided compositions that emphasize separation (we emphasize UNITY)

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Museum/gallery quality
- Editorial/documentary photography standards
- Could appear in National Geographic, The New York Times, or a Korean cultural institution
- Professional color grading
- Intentional, meaningful composition
- Every element serves the narrative

LIGHTING PREFERENCES:
- Golden hour (sunrise/sunset) — hope, new beginnings
- Soft natural window light — intimacy, humanity
- Atmospheric/misty — mystery, timelessness
- Avoid: harsh midday sun, artificial lighting, flash photography aesthetic

COMPOSITION PREFERENCES:
- Breathing room / negative space (Korean aesthetic values emptiness)
- Rule of thirds with intention
- Leading lines toward unity, not division
- Centered subjects for power and dignity
- Avoid: cluttered frames, competing focal points

SUBJECT: A majestic Amur tiger composed of the Korean peninsula landmass, the tiger's body IS the geography — mountains form the spine, coastlines form the fur edges, rivers flow as stripes. The tiger faces left toward the Asian continent.

STYLE: Hyper-detailed digital painting with traditional Korean ink wash (sumukhwa) influence. Muted earth tones with gold accents. The rendering should feel like a precious antique map brought to life.

MOOD: Powerful serenity. Ancient wisdom awakening. The quiet moment before dawn breaks. Hopeful, patient, inevitable.

TECHNICAL: Golden hour lighting from the East Sea (right side). Cinematic 16:9 composition. Atmospheric depth with misty mountains in the background. The 38th parallel visible only as a faint, healing scar across the midsection.

EXCLUDE: No text. No harsh lines. No political symbols. No cartoonish rendering. No bright neon colors.

## ITERATION PROTOCOL

When generating images, follow this process:

### Round 1: Exploration
- Generate 4 variations
- Don't judge yet — look for elements that work
- Note what the AI understood correctly vs. missed

### Round 2: Refinement  
- Take the best elements and make a new prompt
- Add: "Similar to the previous output but with [specific adjustment]"
- Or: "Keep [element X] but change [element Y]"

### Round 3: Polish
- Once you have 80% right, make micro-adjustments
- Lighting, color temperature, crop, specific details
- Generate 4 more variations of the refined prompt

### Round 4: Selection
- Choose the best 1-2 outputs
- Minor editing in Photoshop/Figma if needed (color correction, cropping)
- Archive the prompt that worked for future reference

## CONSISTENCY CHECKLIST

Before accepting ANY image, verify:

☐ **Color palette correct?** (Gold, indigo, cream, vermillion — not random colors)
☐ **Mood aligned?** (Dignified hope, not sad/aggressive/cartoonish)
☐ **Cultural authenticity?** (Would a Korean person feel respected by this?)
☐ **Quality standard?** (Museum/editorial quality, not stock photo generic)
☐ **No text artifacts?** (AI text is always bad — remove or regenerate)
☐ **Unity emphasized?** (Not division, separation, or conflict)
☐ **Tiger energy present?** (Even if no literal tiger — the spirit of patient power)

## FINAL NOTE

The goal is not just good images — it's a **coherent visual world** where every image feels like it belongs in the same documentary, the same exhibition, the same movement.

When someone sees any image from this campaign, they should FEEL:

*"This is serious. This is beautiful. This is ancient. This is hopeful. This is Korean. This is about unity."*

The tiger is patient. The tiger is persistent. The tiger wins.
